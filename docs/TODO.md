# TODO

Here, we collect things we want to do, but don't want to do them now

_dit_ here means one of Idea, Project, Problem, Event, ... i.e. something to figure out, share, or do together

## Roadmap Overview

- [x] Sign in
- [x] CRD interests of self
- [x] CRUD my basic items (Ideas, Problems)
- [ ] Make more basic items (Projects, Events, Groups/Teams, Questions, Things I want to learn ...)
- [x] Make a dummy readonly index
- [x] Setup a dummy readonly index online
- [x] Show indexed items of other people
- [x] Show other people with my interests
- [x] Make & use index that accepts suggestions for indexing
- [ ] Index also updates itself, authenticates people, allows users to remove themselves and their items from the index...
- [ ] See details of items - comment, like, remember
- [ ] Connect with people - write to humans
- [ ] Make it nice looking (get design from somebody, and implement it!)
- [ ] Advertise within the Solid community and outside

## Ideas (Someday/Maybe)

- geo index: People and items have location which is taken into account when suggesting stuff
- propose interests to a person, similar to their interests and their items
- Unbubble - suggest the most dissimilar interests to the person
- Support for all languages
- Seamlessly incorporate DBpedia interests through their owl:sameAs tag to wikidata
- Create and manage a network of physical bases open for public. Something between of Library, Workshop, and Unschooling school for diverse people of all ages <3, especially lower 90%
- Make a mindmap of person's questions, issues, ideas; linked to other people's questions, issues, ideas
- can we connect all the person's knowledge? Books, ideas of others, citations, ... anything that has tags to wikidata or other things? Yeah, that's powerful.
